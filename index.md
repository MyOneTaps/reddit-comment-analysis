## Data

This project aims to study political trends and viewpoints on Reddit, particularly in five of the most popular political subreddits (r/Conservative, r/Democrats, r/Liberal, r/Politics, and r/The_Donald). We scraped our data using two APIs available for Reddit â€“ Pushshift and the official Reddit API, both available in Python. You can find our data [here](https://hu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/amitavarma_hsph_harvard_edu/Documents/BST260-%20Data?csf=1&e=2eX97g).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Prof. Heather Mattie, and our TA Greyson Liu for their guidance in this project for the course BST 260. We would also like to thank Harvard University giving us all the resources we needed to successfully complete the project.
