## Data

This project aims to study political trends and viewpoints on Reddit, particularly in five of the most popular political subreddits (r/Conservative, r/Democrats, r/Liberal, r/Politics, and r/The_Donald).
We scraped our data using two APIs available for Reddit â€“ Pushshift and the official Reddit API, both available in Python.
You can find our data [here](https://hu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/amitavarma_hsph_harvard_edu/Documents/BST260-%20Data?csf=1&e=2eX97g).
